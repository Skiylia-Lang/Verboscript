comment: compute the first n Fibonacci numbers
         0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc...

create a function called fib, with inputs n, a, and b.
  set a to 0 and b to 1 if no input is given.
  create an empty list called out.
  start a counter called x which counts between 0 and n:
    set a and b to a+b and a respectively.
    append the value of b to out.
  return the value of out.

create a variable, n, which is equal to 20.
make an empty list called fibs.
set fibs to the output of the function fib, with input n.
show "the first n Fibonacci numbers are fibs.
