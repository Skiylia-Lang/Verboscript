a program that asks the user for two numbers, and shows the sum, and product of, those numbers.

# Python:
a = input("What is the first number:\n> ")
b = input("What is the second number:\n> ")

print("the sum of", a, "and", b, "is", a+b)
print("the product of", a, "and", b, "is", a*b)

# Verboscript
ask the user "what is the first number?" and store the result in the variable a
ask the user "what is the second number?" and store the result in the variable b
show "the sum of a and b is a plus b"
show "the sum of a and b is a multiplied by b"


a nice feature to have: mathematical equations

two different ways of writing it:

let f(x) equal x^2 + 3.
show f(3).

create a function, f, with input x, that is equal to x squared plus three.
show the function f with input 3.

-> implicit returns -> equivalent to the following
create a function, f, with input x:
  return the value of x^2 + 3.

show the function f with input 3.


terminology

one plus one, one add three, sum of one and two, one + six, add six and five
two to the power six, three squared, cubed, 3**5, 3^6
