# Verboscript

## Verbose, Verbose, Verbose

The entire concept for this language is plain english representation. Anyone, irrespective of programming experience, should be able to read and understand exactly what is happening. For an example of how this can be useful, consider the following:

This example in C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
for(int x = 0; x < 5; x++)
{
    printf(x)
}
```

is equivalent to this example in Python:
```python
for x in range(0, 5):
    print(x)
```

Which could potentially be this, in Verboscript:
```
start a counter at zero, then repeat the following five times:
    show the counter
```

Each layer of abstraction becomes easier to understand in plain english, at the cost of requiring a more complicated program to execute it. Verboscript aims to be completely transparent to anyone, without requiring prior experince with programming languages.

The main directory housing the Verboscript software is [here](../../tree/main/Verboscript).
